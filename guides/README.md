In order to on-board yourself to the Refugee Learning Accelerator online course, you need to complete the following steps: 

1. Set up accounts for yourself on the Refugee Learning Accelerator instances of Mattermost and GitLab. Instructions are [here](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/course-central/blob/master/guides/onboarding.md). 
  * [Here](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/course-central/blob/master/guides/mattermost-mobile.md) are instructions to set up Mattermost on your mobile phone. 
2. If you are the *primary contact* for your team, you will need to choose a team name. Follow [these instructions](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/course-central/blob/master/guides/team-fork.md) to set up your team fork.
  * If you are not the primary contact, ask that person what your team name is. 
3.  Add your photo to the roster. Instructions are [here](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/course-central/blob/master/guides/roster-photo.md). 
Once you have set up both accounts, please introduce yourself in the general channel of [Mattermost](https://mattermost.refugeelearning.site/rla/channels/town-square)!
