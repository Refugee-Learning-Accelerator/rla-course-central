### Adding your photo

We would like to create a roster of all accelerator participants with their names and photos. For this, you should add a photo of yourself in your team project as follows.
1. Clone your project:
  - Copy the URL of your team's project in your subgroup.
  - Go to your terminal and run `git clone [project url]` (without the `[]`).
2. Browse to the `photos` directory and add a photo of yourself. Name the file with your gitlab username, e.g. `vahidfazelrezai.jpg`.
3. Add, commit, and push your changes:
  - Go to the root directory of your project.
  - Run `git add .`.
  - Run `git commit -m 'Add picture'`.
  - Run `git push -u origin master`.
