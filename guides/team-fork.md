# Setting up your team fork

*Make sure you have completed [Getting started with GitLab and Mattermost](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/course-central/blob/master/guides/onboarding.md)!*

In this online course, we will use Gitlab repositories to store all of the course materials and the work your team is doing. We went ahead and created a few groups and subgroups to make coordination easier, but you still need to set up your team environment. Just follow the steps below and ping us on Mattermost if you get stuck. 

For all the [participants](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/groups/rla/group_members) in this course we created a [RLA group](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla). Within the group, we also created a number of [subgroups](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/groups/rla/subgroups) and there should be a subgroup with your team name that includes all of your team members already. 

You can use the sub-group to create a team work space. The work space is a fork of the [team-template project](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/team-template) project. You will commit all your work for the design challenges through this repository. You will also be able to receive materials for the new challenges by pulling from the upstream fork (more about that soon).

If you are new to git or Gitlab and some of this doesn't yet make sense, don't worry! We highly recommend working through some of the tutorials on Git and Gitlab (for example [this one](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/25/gitlab-workflow-an-overview/)) but we will continue to give you step by step instructions, so you should be able to follow along. 

1. Go to the [team-template project](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/team-template).
2. Click `Fork` under the project name.
3. Choose `RLA/[your team name]` as your fork destination. It will take a few moments to finish.
