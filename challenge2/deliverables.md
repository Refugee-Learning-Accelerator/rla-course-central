## The Human Centered Design Challenge has **two deliverables** 

### Make an initial prototype - Due: Sun Nov/19 (midnight Amman)

#### Tasks: 
1. Pick a possible solution to the challenge we discussed this week
2. Create a prototype
3. - Pick a specific method to design a prototype (e.g., a paper prototype, a series of mockups, or an interactive wireframe). 
2. Create a mockup/ prototype. Make it as tangible as possible. 
3. Submit your prototype and documentation (see notes on the deliverable below)
3. Review the prototypes of 3 other groups and leave feedback. 

#### Deliverable 
* What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it)
* Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)
* Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 
* What did you learn during the prototyping process?
* Who are your intended users for testing? 

### Test it with users - Due: Sun Nov/26 (midnight Amman)

#### Tasks: 
1. Identify a group of potential users (or ask your friends and family)
2. Test the prototpye and collect as much feedback as possible
3. Describe how you would change the prototpye based on the feedback (you don't have to make a new version of the prototype!)
4. Incorporate the feedback you gathered into a new iteration of your prototype. 

#### Deliverable
* Describe how you selected your test users and the test setting 
* Share a summary of the feedback you received
* Desribe what changes you would make to your prototype based on the feedback (and why)
* What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?
* What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?
