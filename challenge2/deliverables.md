## The Human Centered Design Challenge has **two deliverables** 

### Initial prototype - Due: Sun Nov/19 (midnight Amman)

#### Tasks: 
1. Select a method to prototype how we might use an everyday technology as a learning tool (e.g., a paper prototype, a series of mockups, or an interactive wireframe). 
2. Build your prototype. Make it as tangible as possible. 
3. Go out into the field and gather feedback from users. 

#### Submit your prototype (photos, video, diagrams etc.) and a paragraph answering the following questions: 
* Describe your prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 
* What did you learn during the prototyping process?
* From whom did you gather feedback? 
* What did you learn during the feedback process? 


### Revised prototype - Due: Sun Nov/26 (midnight Amman)

#### Tasks: 
1. Incorporate the feedback you gathered into a new iteration of your prototype. 

#### Submit your revised prototype (photos, video, diagrams etc.) and a paragraph answering the following questions: 
* How did you iterate on your prototype? 
* What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?
* What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you? 
* If you were to continue working on this prototype, what would your next steps be?
