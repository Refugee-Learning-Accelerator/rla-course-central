## The Human Centered Design Challenge has **two deliverables** 

### Make an initial prototype - Due: Sun Nov/19 (midnight Amman)

#### Tasks: 
1. Pick a possible solution to the "How Might We" statement we discussed this week
2. Create a prototype (your goal is to make it as tangible as possible)
3. Pick a specific method to design a prototype (e.g., a paper prototype, a series of mockups, or an interactive wireframe). 
4. Submit your prototype and documentation (answer the questions below)
5. Review the prototypes of 3 other groups and leave feedback. 

#### Questions to Answer 
* What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)
* Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)
* Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 
* What did you learn during the prototyping process?
* Who are your intended users for testing? 

### Test it with users - Due: Sun Nov/26 (midnight Amman)

#### Tasks: 
1. Identify a group of potential users (fall back: ask your friends and family)
2. Have them **use** the prototype and collect as much feedback as possible
3. Describe how you would change the prototpye based on the feedback (you don't have to make a new version of the prototype!)

#### Questions to Answer
* How did you select your test users? 
* What was the setting of the test? 
* What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 
* What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?
* What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?
* What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?
