# Test it with users - Due: Sun Nov/26 (midnight Amman)

## Tasks:

* Identify a group of potential users (fall back: ask your friends and family)
* Have them use the prototype and collect as much feedback as possible
* Describe how you would change the prototpye based on the feedback (you don't have to make a new version of the prototype!)

## Questions to Answer

1. How did you select your test users? 
   When we choose to work on this solution for HCD challenge we were inspired by some family members who are refugee kids attending school in Erbil, Iraq
   so we tested our prototype with them
2. What was the setting of the test? 
   We have an Android App prototype, we used this app with the kids at home and with teachers(potential volunteers) at their workplace.
   for the kids we did a mockup for the video call and explained to them how the actual call should be.
3. What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 
   We were impressed by each one of the users and we got a great feedback we would like to share them in details:
   * Rezan, 4 years old Syrian lives in Erbil: he is not a student yet but we wanted to test the UI simplicity with him.
     He was able to use the app and navigate from interface to another despite that he can't read yet. 
     He sugessted that we use Red instead of the current color for the App theme :).
   * Mustafa, 9 years old Syrian lives in Erbil: he liked the App so much and the UI was easy for him to use,
     but he had a problem reading the summary info since he is still learning how to read. 
     He sugessted we use voice and text messages beside the video call to communicate with the teachers.
     He was so excited about the idea and kept coming to us asking if we finished developing the App so he can use it :).
   * Leloz, 10 years old Syrian lives in Erbil: she liked the App. the UI was easy for her to use.
     she sugessted to use text and voice messages, add icons beside the text on buttons and would like to use Pink instead of the current color for the App theme :).
   * Muslim, 9 years old Syrian lives in Erbil: He liked the App so much "because it helps the student to learn"
     He sugessted adding voice and text messages and adding more learning subjects :).
4. What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?
5. What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?
6. What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?
