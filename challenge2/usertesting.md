# Challenge 2 User Testing

Problem Statement:
How might we design a translation tool that makes refugee students feel empowered?

Description:
Our prototype is an OCR-based translation tool that has been designed to be simple, handy, practical, and efficient. It can be implemented as an app on hand-held devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets) and uses its camera to capture the content to be translated. Then it performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to recognize and locate the characters within the images and output them as a text script. The latter is then parsed and sent to a state-of-art translator to output it in Arabic.
To demonstrate the concept, we have created an executable version of it that uploads the captured image and applies state-of-art OCR stage by google and English-to-Arabic translator by Yandex to output the final results. 
Here is a video of it illustrating the idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM8OdJ70Cbw 


### How did you select your test users? 

Ideally, the end users for our prototype are the Syrian refugee students located in the hosting countries of English-based educational curriculum. However due to the time constrain for this challenge, we had decided to publish the conceptual prototype through the Syrian Society for Scientific Research network which includes currently ~ 100 members of Syrian researchers all over the world. We were also interested in collecting feedback from those who are working in the translation field, hence, we had reached some translation groups and published our questionnaire on their social pages. 

### What was the setting of the test? 

We had created an internal event on facebook to better reach out to more members in the targeted groups. To better analyze and generate statistics, we have added many multi-choice questions while keeping few for open-ended discussions and suggestions. Please refer to the questionnaire sheet to fully observe the test set: https://goo.gl/JgLLXy

### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

We are still in the process of collecting participantsâ€™ feedback. The deadline for filling the questionnaire is on Tuesday-midnight, hence we shall update this submission with our analyses and statistics by Thursday.

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

We shall address this question once we finish collecting the questionnaire results (by Thursday)!

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

The empathize stage, as developers we used to directly jump to the solutions and the coding parts before even understanding the real-problem.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

The synthesize and ideate phases as they helped us better state the problem based on the real-need and brainstorm to come up with good solutions.
