### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

Doing research and watching people, recording their interaction with asking lots of questions. 
And have in-depth discussion with your team. Seeing the patterns that begin to appear, 
what do people like and what do they dislike.
And how can you make a product that makes a real difference in their lives.
### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

The ability to put yourself in the shoes of another person and see the world from their perspective
was an enlightening experience and helped in shaping a product that is made for the user, 
and not what you think the user wants since in reality a product should actually be useful to the person who is going to be using it.
