# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users? 

The majority of our test users were the refugees who came all the way from Kirkuk, due to the rapid circumstances. For the other part of our test users, we asked our colleagues, friends and family.  
### What was the setting of the test? 

The setting of the test was done by showing them our app, asking the users about their opinions, asking for a feedback, focusing on the way they had used it and trying to check if there was any errors during the processing. On the other hand, we put some content on the app for a better understating and to make them feel like they are dealing with real fully functional app.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

Doing research and watching people, recording their interaction with asking lots of questions. 
And have in-depth discussion with your team. Seeing the patterns that begin to appear, 
what do people like and what do they dislike.
And how can you make a product that makes a real difference in their lives.
### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

The ability to put yourself in the shoes of another person and see the world from their perspective
was an enlightening experience and helped in shaping a product that is made for the user, 
and not what you think the user wants since in reality a product should actually be useful to the person who is going to be using it.
