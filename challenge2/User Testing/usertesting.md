# Test it with users - Due: Sun Nov/26 (midnight Amman)

## Tasks:

* Identify a group of potential users (fall back: ask your friends and family)
* Have them use the prototype and collect as much feedback as possible
* Describe how you would change the prototype based on the feedback (you don't have to make a new version of the prototype!)

## Questions to Answer

1. How did you select your test users?

  We aimed at teachers of a various backgrounds. Some of these teachers taught in the states, others in Dubai, and in local schools.

2. What was the setting of the test?

  We sent a the following [form](https://ebrahimkaram.typeform.com/to/MUcOwh) to those we couldn't reach out. To those who had the time we took their detailed feedback through a *Messenger* or *WhatsApp* conversation.

  However the form allowed the teachers to give their feedback anonymously and had all the time they needed to play around with the UI and get comfortable with the app.

  The paper UI we had before was developed on [Axure](https://www.axure.com/) and we shared it using [Axure Share](https://share.axure.com/)

3. What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)?

   A lot of the teachers were enthusiastic about the idea and like the idea of immediate feedback during their lessons and enjoyed,

   We did get a few constructive criticisms:

   One of the teachers uses https://teacher.desmos.com/popular during his class sessions and he was hoping we could integrate these our current system.

   Another crucial feedback we receive was that this kind of method is limited to subjects that have concrete answers. For example, if the course or session was about abstract reading or analysis, the answers would have to be an essay format and there would be no definitive right choice that would be easy for us to determine the class's performance.
   >"Iâ€™m curious to see the effectiveness of this chart in regards to essay topics or complex topics like social sciences and urban theory"

   >"The app is still diagrammatic so my worry just lies in its effective for essays, essay topics and fields of study that require critical analysis"

   We also received criticism about introducing the phone/tablet to the classroom would be more of a distraction then a benefit.

   Some teacher were requesting if the app could give more insight on how the teacher proceed if the most of class answers wrong.
   >When the student chooses an incorrect answer, what is the role of the teacher in identifying the misconception behind the incorrect answer? For example, it could be a simple math error or a more conceptual misunderstanding. Is there a way to integrate more nuanced data taking into this process?

   You can see the detailed reviews in the `BBBApp-report` in **.csv** and **.xlsx** format.


4. What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?


5. What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

  The constant feedback from users and showing users an incomplete product. We were afraid that users wouldn't get the idea if it wasn't complete yet. So we were a bit hesitant about sharing the UI, we expected a lot more questions from the teachers but everything seemed to work out

6. What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

  The design that was centered on the User. We realized at the start that we have to put them at ease that this wasn't a tool that would be a burden.
