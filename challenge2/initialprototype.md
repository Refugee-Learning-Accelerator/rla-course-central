# Make an initial prototype - Due: Sun Nov/19 (midnight Amman)

## Tasks:

* Pick a possible solution to the "How Might We" statement we discussed this week
* Create a prototype (your goal is to make it as tangible/concrete as possible)
* Pick a specific method to design a prototype (e.g., a paper prototype, a series of mockups, or an interactive wireframe). 
* Submit your prototype and documentation (answer the questions below)
* Review the prototypes of 3 other groups and leave feedback. 

## Questions to Answer

1. What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?) 

    The problem we indecated is that the refugee students are not getting any quality of learning in the camps and in the city, 
    and they are having a hard time doing there homework and exams as even there parents can't help them, so our solution is to provide them with an online volunteer
    teachers via a mobile app, these teachers will help them with their homework and make them understand what they couldn't understand in the school.

2. Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)
   We created our prototype as an Android App, we added some interfaces so we can test it with our users and get feedback
   the first interface contains two button to select wether the user is a teacher or a student

3. Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method.    

    Our Prototype is an Android app, we did some UI's to explain our solution, and we chose this prototype because it's testable,
    and we can test it with potential users and get feedback from them. 

4. What did you learn during the prototyping process?

    Implementing the human centered design process made us learn a lot about the people we want to help,
    especially when we start thinking like them and we put ourself in there situation, 
    during the prototyping we started to think about the many many features we can add and how much we can improve our solution.


5. Who are your intended users for testing?


    Some refugee studetns inside the camps, and also some refugee students lives in the city attending public school in second shifts at night.
