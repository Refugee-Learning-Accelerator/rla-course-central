# Make an initial prototype - Due: Sun Nov/19 (midnight Amman)

## Tasks:

* Pick a possible solution to the "How Might We" statement we discussed this week
* Create a prototype (your goal is to make it as tangible/concrete as possible)
* Pick a specific method to design a prototype (e.g., a paper prototype, a series of mockups, or an interactive wireframe).
* Submit your prototype and documentation (answer the questions below)
* Review the prototypes of 3 other groups and leave feedback.

## Questions to Answer

1. What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

  We decided to aim at making a solution for School teachers who would be working with 30 plus students in a classroom after school hours.

  We saw that it was a problem that was not the most addressed by most technology and is quite a hassle as pointed out by **LASeR** in the second session
2. Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

  Please check the other documents in the [Initial Prototype](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/BeirutByByte/team-template/blob/master/challenge2/Initial%20Prototype) folder.
3. Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method.

  Our prototype is going to be an app that has a main admin and users. The admin would be the teacher and the users would be the students.

  As an initial prototype it will just a UI (fluidUI) and a flow chart of the algorithm/process. We chose these methods because we thought it really shows the essence of what the project is and people could directly give feedback on the steps taken or the UI.

  The Usage of the App would look like this (Please refer to the [The Step by Step Procedure](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/BeirutByByte/team-template/blob/master/challenge2/Initial%20Prototype/The%20Step%20by%20Step%20Procedure.PNG))
  * Before the session starts. The teacher uploads the seating plan of the users to the app / or the users input their column or row in the room.
  * She starts the lesson and at each milestone. She stops and prompts a question
  * The question shows up on the phone of every user/student. If not enough phones. then the users could easily share the phone and answer together.
  * The students answer the question on a phone or tablet
  * Then the teacher gets feedback whether to repeat or proceed
    * If the yield (number of correct answers) is low, the teacher will repeat the explanation and do what she sees fit to get the message better across. Then she will prompt another question to the students which falls under the same concept
    * If the yield is high, the teacher will give the answer to the question, then wait X minutes for the students to discuss among themselves on the answer. (the people who got it wrong ask those who got it right )
  * If she proceeds the student who got it wrong, gets a message to ask a student thatâ€™s seating close to him(according to the seating plan) to help him after class or during the X minute break.

  Extra Features
  * Users could ask for harder questions
  * Users get marked as tutors and helpers

  Main Philosophy: *Groupwork: because you can't claim to have mastered something until you can teach it*
4. What did you learn during the prototyping process?

  We had lots of ideas but they failed to address the current users and their situation.

  We had an idea about doing a more advanced and interactive curriculum but we realized that the overworked teacher wouldn't really want to do more work and she would probably follow the mentality of `if it isn't broken don't fix it`

  We also went through probably doing some online sessions for the teacher, where the teacher records the session before hand and sends it to the students and they come back with their questions, but as pointed by Madam Zeina the internet connection is almost non-existent here in Lebanon.

  So at the end we needed to have the following in our idea
    * A small or no adjustment for the teacher
    * A system that wouldn't require an internet access but could use a LAN connection
    * Needs to be used in the classroom
    * Gets all the students involved and participating (to reduce the dropout rate)
    * Expenses are limited as well as resources
5. Who are your intended users for testing?

  Our intended users would be Lebanese teachers and Syrian students. We are hoping to see how this app would scale and perform when you have over 30 students in a classroom.
