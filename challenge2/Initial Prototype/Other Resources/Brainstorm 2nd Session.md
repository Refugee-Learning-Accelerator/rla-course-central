# 1. Share memorable quotes and information
Shortage of tools

Education is not that appealing

the internet connectivity is a big issue for school students, not for univerities

Gamification of learning brought very good results

Students are dropping out
50 people in a classroom
Lebanese teachers after hours so they are exhausted.

70 percent of students dropped out.

# 2.Find themes and insights

Get a degree that could help actually get a job
There a higher need to help with primary education rather than university education.
Connection free because of the poor internet conditions

# 3. What Surprised You
They actually used duo lingo to help them learn English

They do not support programs if they don't have market fitting

People who dropped out are still interested in education

# 4. Craft a strong problem statement
(How might we... ? [Functional need] + [user] + [emotional need])

Funtional need: -Decrease Dropouts -Learn English easier -Get a degree suitable for the market

user: - teacher - Syrian students

Emotional Need: Student -> to be more involved -Teaher -> Easier way to interact with them.

How might WE (Syrian Students and teachers) have a more  appealing & competitive  teaching experience that decreases dropouts and eases the stress on the students

The point is that we need to solve the dropout problem and not wait for it to happen and then work it out

# 5. Brainstorm: defer judgement, encourage wild ideas, build on others, stay focused, have one conversation at a time, go for quantity, be visual

Streaming classes from regular sessions + tutors to help in answering questions, so the teacher doesn't really have to explain everything again?

A logging system for questions from the students. These questions come anonymously and it would be better to handle in a class of 50 for the teacher.

Record the session before . Let them watch the session with animations and explanations. Breakout when needed for exercises and questions.

Ebrahim: So the idea till now is gonna be iot, Something were it would be easier to manage a class of 50. So maybe each student with a clicker and a question on an LCD. Depending on the percentage of right answers, Teacher advances or repeats

Salam: This looks fine, while what i meant is that the lecture would be recorded for the other students to watch and that would reduce the pressure over the teacher, where she will be focusing on personalized feedback based on the questions of the students rather than the regular “one size fits all” lecture.

Now if that would be the idea, then we need to make sure it is attractive. As far as I know, recorded videos are as boring as a regular lecture, and we emphasized that those are not regular students, those are students that are already willing to leave the classroom and never come back. Now in that regards, getting hands on would get them interested.

See http://tryengineering.org/ it gives you TONS of ideas and hands-on activities to learn STEM and get something useful and functional from very cheap and abundant parts.

In my opinion, it doesn’t have to be programmable or through an app, it can just be easily a new approach for refugees which is completely different from the Lebanese curriculum, a tailored curriculum that would equip them with the knowledge to create solutions for their communities and for their own problems as soon as possible. They know their problems better and they can iterate through them at a much better level than we do. Going back to giving a man fish vs teaching him how to catch it!

What do you think? Shall we go from this point on or you think we need to reform the way I am thinking about it?


Ebrahim: Well I guess it’s a good solution, but I don’t want to increase the learning curve for the teacher by telling her she needs to adapt to a new way of thinking and a new curriculum. I prefer we stick with the current curriculum since its the curriculum most universities accept and is already accredited if they want to pursue higher learning.
