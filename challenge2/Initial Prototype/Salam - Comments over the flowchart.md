Great flowchart!

Block2: we need to note that the row and column are printed on the corner of the table for ease of entry, or even add a QR code to scan over the table

Block4: Who is admin? Is it the teacher or a bot? We need to specify, I guess.

Block5: They get the question on their Phone/Tablet? Are we assuming the students are going to use their own electronics? Shouldn’t it be a unified platform provided by the school?

In the X minutes … whether now or later? Why would it be later? I believe “now” is the time to learn this new concept, so they have to get the needed understanding through this session

In general, we need a system of tokens governing the whole learning process, a motive to keep on going. That will not only reward the ones who got the right answers, but those who tried the most (if we will prompt them with optional questions to tackle the subject – easier or harder) and with a rating from the student who needed help for the student who offered explanation support.
