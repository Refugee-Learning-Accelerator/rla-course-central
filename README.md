## Origin of the name
We wanted something that really stood out and something that was a play on words.

We went from a list of names. To list a *few*:
HardRandom - Coditt - Byters - BeirutByBit - Complexity - BigOhNo - Probably Programmers - Code and Chill

We also thought of Johnny Cache - Fugscript


***Finally***: We decided to go with Beirut By Bit which developped into BeirutByByte

**It's the triple B threat Y'alll**
