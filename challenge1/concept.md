# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

## Description

The main idea in our bot project is to make a calculator bot , that can calculate the arithmetic operations of a given equation that have more than one arithmetic operator.

Or by giving it a function represented by variables with the values of these variables,  and in the end the bot will calculate the result of the equation and will send it to the user. 

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

More than 99% of the phones calculators can't solve the multi arithmetic operators equations , the usual calculator takes the first number , the arithmetic operator and the second number , so it can't handle the big equations.

### How will the chatbot solve it? 


By calculating the answer of the given equations and send it to the user.


### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

This chatbot can be used by all students , either in school or in college

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

Calculate the big equations with more than 2 arithmetic operator , it can't be possible without using the usual phone calculator 

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

Calculating the trigonometric ratios , the powers and the roots
