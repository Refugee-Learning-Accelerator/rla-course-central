# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

Since we are creating an online educational platform, it would be great to create a messenger customer service chatbot answering the common questions, interact with students, and guide them.

Students might need help especially in the beginning about how they register? are they eligible to enroll? what are the available courses? Etc. Here the chatbot duty to interact with the students, answer them, guide them, giving them the URLs and necessary info.

Hiring customer service employees for the platform is something costly, though, I don't have a guarantee that the response is done instantly. Using chatbot, students/users will feel comfortable to get help instantly without making the users waiting in queue to get support.

I think we are going to encounter some challenges in supporting the Arabic language and starting with a small knowledge base.

On the other hand, our platform has a mentor support for the enrolled students, and we are planning to develop the chatbot using AI to make the chatbot answering the questions instead, but that needs several months and solid knowledge base.
