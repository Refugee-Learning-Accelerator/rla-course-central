# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

## Description

A chatbot that helps refugees with their SAT, ACT, and other standardized tests.

The final product we hope would be bluetooth based. This would make the chatbot independent of a WiFi connection. The chatbot helps refugees to learn concepts and terms that are common in standardized tests which are part of the admission process in most Universities .  

The first version of our chatbot will help refugees learn common english SAT words.

### How will it  be used
1. **Method 1:**
Each refugee has a smartphone access to the chatbot. The chatbot asks basic SAT questions with their respective multiple choice answers. Each student records the answer on his/her smartphone. The chatbot registers the progress of the group and decides whether it moves on to the next question or further explains the concept to the group. It would also trigger those who got it right to explain to their friends why this is the correct answer. If an individual is too shy to ask his/her peers for help. He could ask the chatbot the question and it could help by providing the Arabic translation of the word and possible use cases of the word. If the chatbot can not answer the question, the chatbot will redirect the question anonymously to one of his peers who might know the answer.

**Note:** _Since the chatbot would be bluetooth based, all the members of the session would have to be sitting within close proximity of each other. As a result it would be very simple for them to ask their collegues of the correct answer. It also simplifies the process of exchanging data between their peers. In addition, the phones would not need to be connected to a Wifi/Mobile Network to play. _  

1. **Method 2:** If smartphone resources are limited, the game could be played with one smartphone. The group would sit around one smartphone. One of them would be dedicated an MC. Choosing the MC would be done by passing the chatbot around to each peer and the chatbot a series of random questions to each. The chatbot will ask a series of questions to each to determine who is the better fitted individual to lead the session. After indicating who is the MC, the chatbot starts the series of questions. The MC decides to put the answer that the majority agrees on and the chatbot decides whether to go to the next question or clarify the current word more by providing translations to the word and example of uses.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

* We presume in our Chatbot that the refugees know a basic level of English which might not be the case in most situations.

* If not enough smartphones are available, then method 2 of usage would have to be implemented which deprives a lot of key features in the app especially identifying weaknesses and strengths of the individual rather than the group.

* We also assume that refugees would be willing to help each other and that the strongest of the group doesn't mind being constantly asked on how something is done. This would be extremely taunting especially if he is the only one who seems to get the questions right in a very big group.

* The chatbot can't answer any specific questions and it's first line of defense is to redirect to a peer who might know the answer. If he/she  doesn't know, then the chatbot would require an internet connection to redirect the question to an expert/volunteer who has the answers

* Not finding adeqaute translations to all the concepts and terms used in standardized tests.
