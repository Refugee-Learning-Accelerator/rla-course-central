# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

## Description

Frankie (short for Frankenstein) is a chatbot that connects refugee learners to science teachers to help answer science-related questions. Furthermore, Frankie gamifies this process by only allowing students to make a set number of requests per day.

Frankie works in three key ways:

1. Frankie connects learners to an on-demand knowledge base – Frankie engages with students to better understand the type of science question they have. To start with, that means having the student select which science subject they are stuck in, and any supporting content (images / text) that helps explain the problem they are facing. That information is then presented to a community of science teachers, who have already agreed to receive messages from the Frankie bot to connect to and help refugees struggling in science-related questions. These students should be fluent in Arabic + English / French.

2. Frankie gamifies tutoring to ensure only the most difficult questions are asked – Since refugee learners will not be paying for this service, as other tutoring platforms would require, we need to ensure that teachers only spend their time helping answer the most difficult questions. To do this, Frankie will limit each student to only one question per day (subject to change based on testing), thus forcing the student to really focus on the one question or concept they need assistance with that day.

3. Knowledge sharing – To prevent redundant questions, Frankie will learn (with ML frameworks) to identify questions that seem similar, and will notify students of possible answers before they use up their one question request. Frankie will also keep a log of questions/answers that users can search through.


## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve?

The chatbot will help solve this problem by connecting learners to teachers, and allowing them to engage in an academic discussion over messenger.

### How will the chatbot solve it?

The chatbot will help solve this problem by connecting learners to teachers, and allowing them to engage in an academic discussion over messenger.

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?
There are two primary users.

1. Middle school / high school students – we will engage these users initially through NGO partnerships with refugee education service providers.

2. Science teachers who speak Arabic + English or French – University partnerships. To start with, AUB.

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible?

On-demand science support with a native Arabic speaker and teacher who is available and willing to help.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

1. Making sure we get the right questions to the right teachers

2. Setting time frames on each session – We cannot expect volunteer teachers to willingly spend a lot of time on one request and so we will need to find an acceptable balance so that both the student and teacher are happy.

3. Keeping teachers interested – If they are not getting paid, what other ways can we keep them passionate about the impact they are providing? This won’t be an issue in the beginning, but donor fatigue is real for everyone, and needs to be accounted for. How do we sustain participation from the support community?
