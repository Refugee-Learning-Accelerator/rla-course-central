* when you say Bluetooth base, do you mean without an internet

 **Answer:** Yes A completely internet independent application. We wanted this since most refugee camps don't have Wi-Fi and data is kinda of expensive

* so is it an app on the phone? full chat-bot on the app?

 **Answer:** For the moment it's a chatbot but the future implementation down the line would be an app since we want to make this product completely internet independent

* for the 2nd method can it be for someone that wants to help in the camp like can a volunteer that can teach there or you can add this option

**Answer:** Yes it could be. We could add a volunteer mentor in case there are not enough phones but *method 2* is not really the main focus of the project

wish you all best and success, regards from futuristic-school

Hey Team BeirutByByte!

Thanks for submitting your concept.

Here is some feedback:

* I'm really excited about the "social" side of your idea and how chatbots could be used to facilitate this. I think the prospect of using a chatbot to help guide group study is really interesting/creative.

**Gratitude:** We are glad you are excited about the idea

* I'm curious how this would actually work technically, especially if the study group does not have access to Wifi. How would the chatbot know that they were working together? Would there be some sort of additional login procedure?

**Answer:** Each member would have a unique id with his app. Every message is sent via bluetooth and its sent along with his ID. That ID would help us know who is working with who and what they sent

* I'm wondering where you plan to get your curriculum from

**Answer:** Major Tests.com has a few pratice tests which can be used. [here](majortests.com)
* Are there already other organizations using chatbots to facilitate studying for standardized tests?

**Answer:** Not that we know of

* Is the SAT really the most relevant standardized test to the refugee population in the Middle East?

**Answer:** Surprisingly enough in Lebanon there are alot of Universities that take SATs as part of their admission or it could be used to replace their English entry exam
You have AUB LAU balamand AUST usek
These Universities are rated some of the best in the country and region. We thought that giving them the chance to apply by using a chatbot would really help
