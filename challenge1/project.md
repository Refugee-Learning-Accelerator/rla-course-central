# Challenge 1 Final Project

## Description

For the first challenge, we came up with the concept of a chatbot that we're calling "Ustaz Fahmi" (الأستاذ فهمي) to serve both refugees students and teachers. Ustaz Fawzi's main purpose is to make it easy for students who need tutoring or help in a certain subject at school to find a suitable teacher. It is common for refugees to find it difficult to find a tutor that suits them, for example, cost and location wise. Nevertheless, many people who are willing and able to help are available, but don’t know where to start or how to help. Ustaz Fahmi is a useful link between these people and students that need tutoring sessions. Each time a student requests help, Ustaz Fahmi asks him for contact information and specific tutoring needs (material, number of sessions...) and provides him with several tutors options based on his specifications. When a tutor contacts Ustaz Fahmi, he must provide his contact information and teaching preferences (material, level of students, session duration…) and Ustaz Fahmi will store these data for future students’ requests.
