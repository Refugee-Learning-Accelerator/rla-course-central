## Description

*[Describe and demonstrate your chatbot. Videos, screenshots or images are encouraged.]*

## Questions

### How did you build it (platform and technology)?

Building the chatbot conversation nodes and connecting them was done by Chatfuel. The chatbot UI is the Facebook messenger whcih could be accessed from the messenger app or from a web browser on a computer.
The chatbot also uses the Facebook NLP wit.ai to understand more variaty of user input.
We also set up an independed web server on Heroku and connected it to a facebook bot. This is ready for future expanding when we might need to do more suficticated backend operations.

### What challenges did you face?

After switching between Arabic and English, having the bot capable of carying on in a similar flow int eh other langauge was chllenging.

### What aspect of the chatbot do you like best? 

I like that unlike a website, the chatbot provides a friendly feeling and more humanized support.
In addition to providing the service of presenting courses and helping to plan the study process, it helps to keep the student engaged with his study schedule and more connected to his study plan becasue of the humanized friendly flavor in the chatbot.

### What would you different in the future? 

I would try to get the protype to real enironment like actuall refugee students and see what type of blockers or complains they might face. That would help to tweek the conversation options to better solve the real life issues.

### Are there any parts of your code you'd like to highlight?

Chatfuel has a great way of utilizing the NLP within the conversation. We used it particularly for choosing the langauge English vs Arabic. it gives the user freedo to say his language choice in any way and in any of the two langugaes Arabic and English.
this is demonstrated in a seperate video names NLP.language.choice
