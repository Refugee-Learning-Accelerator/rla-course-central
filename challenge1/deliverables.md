## The Chatbot Challenge has **two deliverables** 

#### 1. Concept Sketch - Due: Sun Nov/5 (midnight Amman)

Describe your concept for a chatbot in one or two paragraphs. Use visuals (mockups, diagrams) if possible. It is important to be as specific as possible while mapping out the scope of the project as this will greatly influence implementation and the tools to use. 

Answer the following questions:
- What problem/ challenge will the chatbot solve? 
- How will the chatbot solve it? 
- Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?
- What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 
- What challenges do you expect to encounter? 

#### 2. Final Project - Due: Sun Nov/12 (midnight Amman)
Demonstrate how your chatbot works. Videos, screenshots or images are encouraged. 

Add a short description and answer the following questions: 
- How did you build it? (Platform and technology)
- What challenges did you face?
- What aspect of the chatbot do you like best? 
- What would you different in the future? 
- Please also add a link to your code!

## How to Submit

Instructions will be posted here and emailed out later in the week.
