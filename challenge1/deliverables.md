## The Chatbot Challenge has **two deliverables** 

#### Concept Sketch - Due: Sun Nov/5 (midnight Amman)

Describe your concept for a chatbot in one or two paragraphs. Use visuals (mockups, diagrams) if possible. It is important to be as specific as possible while mapping out the scope of the project as this will greatly influence implementation and the tools to use. 

Answer the following questions:
- What problem/ challenge will the chatbot solve? 
- How will the chatbot solve it? 
- Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?
- What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 
- What challenges do you expect to encounter? 

#### Final Project - Due: Sun Nov/12 (midnight Amman)
Demonstrate how your chatbot works. Videos, screenshots or images are encouraged. 

Add a short description and answer the following questions: 
- How did you build it? (Platform and technology)
- What challenges did you face?
- What aspect of the chatbot do you like best? 
- What would you different in the future? 
- Please also add a link to your code!

## How to Submit

All of the following steps must be completed at least once per team (if all of your team members use git, you will want to replicate them on each team memberâ€™s computer). This week you need to use git in the termina (Command Prompt application on Windows, Terminal application on Mac); ask for help on [Mattermost](https://mattermost.refugeelearning.site/rla/channels/help) if you run into trouble.

#### 1. Download the deliverables templates
- Pull new content from the upstream `team-template` into your fork. On the command line, run the following commands:
    - If you've already cloned your team's workspace, navigate to the folder. If not, run `git clone https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/[TEAM NAME]/team-template; cd team-template;` (replace the expession in `[]` and remove the `[]`).
    - Run: `git remote add upstream https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/team-template; git fetch upstream;`
    - Run: `git checkout master; git pull origin master;`
    - Run: `git rebase upstream/master;`
    - Run: `git push origin master;`

#### 2. Prepare your work for submission 
- Store all of your work in the new `challenge1` folder.
- Fill out the `.md` files with your submission answers (`concept.md` for the first week, `project.md` for the second week).

**Make sure you have commited and pushed your work by Sunday midnight (Amman time).** At that point, the work in your team's workspace will be **automatically** copied into the central course project (thanks to a nifty little script that @vahidfazelrezai wrote).
