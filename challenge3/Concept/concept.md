# Challenge 3 Concept Sketch

## Description

*[Describe your concept for how low fidelity Augmented Reality could be used to support language learning in one or two paragraphs. Use visuals (mockups, diagrams) if possible. It is important to be as specific as possible while mapping out the scope of the project as this will greatly influence implementation and the tools to use. ]*

We are trying to follow a learn as

We tried to keep the following in mind
* Ability to be used on an Android phone
* Low reliance on GPS and mobile Data
* Ability to learn later and not in the augmented reality necessarily.
* Promote the user to go out and engage with the world.
