# Notes From Seminar Breakout 1
## When are the best  opportunities to learn?

Bob: on the 5 km walk. He gets directions on where to go following a video stream


## What sites offer best opportunities to interact

USING MIXED REALITY?

On the Route he passes by the following from what I remember.
* Supermarket
* Bakery
* Class
* Unicef help center

How are we gonna use AR on the phone: Google Cardboard https://aframe.io/a-painter/


## How could mixed Reality enable Context-specific of learning?
Pokemon: point and show
Using the sensors that we know

## What would be role of peers/social interaction

The AR would help develop social skills when they need it in certain environments. They could learn specific phrases that would help with their daily social interactions

## How could mixed reality be applied to different language learning problems: vocab acquisition; developing sentence structure; grammar; presentation/confidence; ’thinking in english’

Well if people know what to say and what to expect in different contexts they can have better presentation and better thinking since they know what should come next.
