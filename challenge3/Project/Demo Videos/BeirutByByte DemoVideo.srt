Hello my name is Emad  El Yehya

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,710
and i'm from the BeirutByByte team and

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,710
I will be demoing the project that we did for the third challenge of MIT's refugee learning accelerator

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,279
Initially we had to plan to film a person using this as he approaches the Bluetooth beacon as well as his interactions with the phone

5
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:23,669
But due to some technical difficulties were not able to put the AR into Android so we will demo the different components individually

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,990
I'll start by turning on Bluetooth. I'm near the beacon so the notification should pop up pretty soon and there we are

7
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,719
Alright, so there's obviously an instructions page for when the app is run for the first time

8
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,719
But I didn't show it for brevity's sake

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,160
So what the user should do is he usually directed towards this symbol

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,539
And then the AR would begin since this part is not incorporated

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,840
We've hard coded the app to just run directly to the next stage and we'll demo now the AR part

12
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,680
After the symbol has been identified and the video has been played, the camera exits and shows the learner the conversation he has just heard

13
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,910
He can click on any sentence

14
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,109
And then the sentence would be spoken out loud to him and he can

15
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,849
Hear that as many times as he wants and there's obviously an Arabic translation there as well

16
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,149
Sadly Google does not allow internal recording

17
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:57,059
So there's no way for us to show you the voice however the voice is exactly the same as the voice that has appeared

18
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,280
during the

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,840
video itself

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,140
Now when the when the learner is done

21
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,959
He simply presses continue, and it goes back to the recording stage where he can look for other symbols

22
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,159
Note that previewing the same symbol on the same day

23
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,199
We show him the same segment as he had seen before

24
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,589
This is because we believe that bite-sized lessons are best for casual learning as well as the fact that this will help the learner

25
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:29,370
review the conversation after having gotten everything translated for him, which further enforces his understanding of the

26
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Concepts we're trying to get across
