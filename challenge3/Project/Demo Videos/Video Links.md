The video was shot by Salam El Bsat and it demos how we have a video player overlaid on of of the stickers

This would ideally be next to a wall or a register in a store where the user could scan with his/her phone and get the [popup video](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/BeirutByByte/team-template/blob/master/challenge3/Project/Register%20Video/Register%20Scene%20With%20Subtitles%20embedded.mp4) with the phrases being said below.
