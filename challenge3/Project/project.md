# Challenge 3 Final Project

## Description

We had a few changes from the previous idea
* We want to make the app a bit more interactive so instead of phrases we used videos
* The video has sample phrases he can learn
* These phrases can be translated in the app and replayed each alone
* Focused on a bite-sized learning approach. On every new return, he would get a new lesson every time

The user would walk into a store and see a sticker/ wallpaper that tells him to scan.
He scans it with his phone on the dedicated app and it would initiate a video of a register conversation

## Questions

### How did you build it? (Platform and technology)

Unity and Android Studio. We used AR Vuforia and a sample video playback project.

### What challenges did you face?

* A limited internet connection and packages that were sometimes over a GB in size.
* Learning Unity.
* Integrating the Unity Project into Android Studios
* Getting the Bluetooth Notification to work

### What aspect of the AR experience do you like best?

It's quite simple to implement with Vuforia. You just need to adapt to the environment and workflow.  

### What would you different in the future?

We did face a few problems
* Due to a few compilation errors, we were not able to build the Unity project or export it into Android studio.
* In the future, the AR and the Android app would be in one application on the users phone.
* We would also have wanted to add a place where he could see the video again in his inventory. We don't want the user to go every time into AR mode to see the video
* Do more than one video for the same concept in order to show the bite-sized learning approach. That way when the user comes another day and scans again he gets another lesson.



### Please also add a link to your code!
Due to huge packages and the very limited internet connection we could not upload the code to GitLab. However, we would like to mention that the AR project is based on the following git repository below:
https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/BeirutByByte/BBBARUnity

This was the very early version of the AR App. We later on had to add a lot of extra libraries and code. The App then became over half a GB and uploading proved to be quite a hassle.
