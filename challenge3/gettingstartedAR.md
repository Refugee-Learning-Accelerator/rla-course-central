# Getting Started with AR/VR

## Definitions

*VR (Virtual Reality)* - the computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment

*AR (Augmented Reality)* - Overlays computer-generated video onto camera-captured video in such a way that the CGI objects appear to have an absolute location in the real world

In this challenege, we will be focusing on AR. 

### How to Download Unity

AR can be intimidating at first, but you’ll find that once you install Unity it’s much easier than you think! And it’ll be super cool. 

Unity is a game development engine, and is widely used for VR and AR development. It makes a lot of tasks really simple, and can output apps to your computer, phone, web, and hololens. We’re going to provide a project on gitlab that you can use to do basic AR and image recognition. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to: hisham.bedri@gmail.com or gabef@mit.edu.

_Before the seminar on Wednesday_, we need you to install Unity, as well as download the [Basr project folder](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/course-central/tree/master/challenge3/basr) from gitlab and put it somewhere on your computer. Also, we need you to [print out this target image](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/course-central/blob/master/challenge3/Print%20this%20image%20for%20Wednesday.jpg) to use for AR.
