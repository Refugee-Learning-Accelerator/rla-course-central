Challenge 3 Final Project


Description

[ The app will use the camera with AR to scan for random objects then a question appear which related to the object scanned. ]


Questions


How did you build it? (Platform and technology)

[Using Unity]


What challenges did you face?

[This was the first time using Unity, so every step was a challenge.]


What aspect of the AR experience do you like best?

[that we can connect to google image scan reader]


What would you different in the future?

[I'll add random objects to environment, because maybe in real world 
(and if the user is in camp) will not find a lot of objects, so he can just search for imagery objects
something like "Pokemon go"  it will be more fun]


Please also add a link to your code!
