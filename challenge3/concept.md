# Challenge 3 Concept Sketch

## Description

*[AR technology has the potential to improve language learning, since visualization and interactivity foster better memory retention and increase student performance, as well as lower
Student anxiety.
A language learning game that focuses on vocabulary, to increase second language learners' motivation.  By viewing an object through a mobile device camera, the user is exposed to enhanced virtual layers placed on top of the real object. As soon as the user’s camera points at the predeﬁned trigger, namely an image or object, augmented media pop up and the user has to construct or put together an object in the environment using the augmented materials. IE the user will be asked to make a salad. First you will be asked to choose the tomatoes and cut them the user would have to choose which is object is a tomato.

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve? 

*[This AR experience would adress the lack of language barrier, avoid going to overcrowded classrooms by getting knowledge at home instead and it would also be a sort of a new level of self-learning type of education.]*

### How will the AR experience solve it? 

*[[This AR experience would help the user to learn the basics of that language he wants to learn, enable the user to explore their surroundings and engage with them by providing an environment that asks the users to drag and drop objects to dicorate a room, which they have to choose the right ones as they were asked to choose.]*

### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

*[The primary user will be refugees living in a country that’s doesn’t use their native language focus on a hand-held display, namely a mobile device. This type of display is portable and widespread, especially among younger generation, 
The user would open the app and point the user’s camera at the predeﬁned trigger, namely an image or object, augmented media pop up and the user has to construct or put together an object in the environment using the augmented materials. IE the user will be asked to make a salad. First you will be asked to choose the tomatoes and cut them the user would have to choose which is object is a tomato. Next the user is asked to pick the carrots and once they have correctly chosen the carrots it would be added to the bowl.
