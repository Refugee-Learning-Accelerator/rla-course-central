# Challenge 3 Concept Sketch

## Description

*[Describe your concept for how low fidelity Augmented Reality could be used to support language learning in one or two paragraphs. Use visuals (mockups, diagrams) if possible. It is important to be as specific as possible while mapping out the scope of the project as this will greatly influence implementation and the tools to use. ]*

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve? 

*[This AR experience would adress the lack of language barrier, avoid going to overcrowded classrooms by getting knowledge at home instead and it would also be a sort of a new level of self-learning type of education.]*

### How will the AR experience solve it? 

*[[This AR experience would help the user to learn the basics of that language he wants to learn, enable the user to explore their surroundings and engage with them by providing an environment that asks the users to drag and drop objects to dicorate a room, which they have to choose the right ones as they were asked to choose.]*

### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

*[The primary users of this experience are those who are willing to learn a new language, people who do not have enough money to spend on courses and those who are willing to get knowledge at home.]*

### What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context? 

*[The only hardware the user needs is to have a smartphone and an internet(atleast once to download the application)]*
