# Getting started with GitLab and Mattermost

Follow these steps to set up your GitLab and Mattermost accounts. We will be using GitLab to host all our code and instructions. We will be using Mattermost as our chat platform.
1. Go [here](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site) and register a new account. This is an instance of GitLab specifically for the accelerator, so you will need to create a new account even if you already have one on GitLab.com.
2. Go [here](https://mattermost.refugeelearning.site) and click `GitLab`.
3. Join the RLA team.
4. Introduce yourself in the General channel!
5. Go back to [GitLab](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site). Click `Groups`, then `Explore public groups`, then `RLA`, then `Request Access`. Your request should be approved within a few seconds.
