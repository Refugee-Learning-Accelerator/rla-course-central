# Using Mattermost on mobile

You can access the RLA Mattermost team on your phone as well as in a web browser. Though this is optional, it may be more convenient depending on your situation. Follow these steps to get set up:
1. Download the Mattermost mobile app. It should be the first result if you search for "Mattermost" in the Play Store or App Store.
2. For the server URL, enter `https://mattermost.refugeelearning.site` (not http).
3. Tap on GitLab as your login method.
4. Sign in with your RLA GitLab account.
5. You can configure your notification settings by clicking on the three bars (â˜°) > Account Settings > Notifications, and choosing settings for mobile and email notifications.
