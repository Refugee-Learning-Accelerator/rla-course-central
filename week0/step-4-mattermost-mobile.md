# Using Mattermost on mobile

You can access the RLA Mattermost team on your phone as well as in a web browser. Though this is optional, it may be more convenient depending on your situation. Follow these steps to get set up:
1. Download the Mattermost mobile app. It should be the first result if you search for "Mattermost" in the Play Store or App Store.
2. For the server URL, enter `https://mattermost.refugeelearning.site` (not http).
3. Tap on GitLab as your login method.
4. Sign in with your RLA GitLab account.
