# Week 0 

In this online course, we will use GitLab repositories to store all of the course materials and the work your team is doing.  Just follow the steps below and ping us on Mattermost if you get stuck.

In order to on-board yourself to the Refugee Learning Accelerator online course, you need to complete the following steps:

1. Set up accounts for yourself on the Refugee Learning Accelerator instances of Mattermost and GitLab. Instructions are [here](step-1-onboarding.md). Once you have set up both accounts, please introduce yourself in the general channel of [Mattermost](https://mattermost.refugeelearning.site/rla/channels/town-square)!

2. *One person from each team*  will need to set up your team and workspace following [these instructions](step-2a-register-team). 
    + When the team has been set up, the rest of the team should register themselves following [these instructions](step-2b-register-member.md).

3.  Add your photo to the roster. Instructions are [here](step-3-upload-photo.md).

4. You may optionally also set up Mattermost on your smartphone, following instructions [here](step-4-mattermost-mobile.md).

If you are new to git or GitLab and some of this doesn't yet make sense, don't worry! We highly recommend working through some of the tutorials on git and GitLab (for example [this one](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/25/gitlab-workflow-an-overview/)) but we will continue to give you step by step instructions, so you should be able to follow along.
