# Week 0 

In this online course, we will use GitLab repositories to store all of the course materials and the work your team is doing.  Just follow the steps below and ping us on Mattermost (after you have created an account) if you get stuck. 

If you are new to git or GitLab and some of this doesn't yet make sense, don't worry! We highly recommend working through some of the tutorials on git and GitLab (for example [this one](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/25/gitlab-workflow-an-overview/)) but we will continue to give you step by step instructions, so you should be able to follow along.

## Please complete the following steps

1. Follow [these instructions](step-1-onboarding.md) to set up accounts in our private GitLab and Mattermost servers. 

3. Once you have set up both accounts, please **introduce yourself** in the general channel of [Mattermost](https://mattermost.refugeelearning.site/rla/channels/town-square)!
  - What's your name, where are you from, and what's your [Mexican wrestler](http://gangstaname.com/names/mexican_wrestler#.WfEMEROPIo8) title? 

2. **One person from each team**  will need to set up your team and workspace following [these instructions](step-2a-register-team.md). Coordinate this with your team members!

4. Once the team has been set up, **all other team members** need to register themselves following [these instructions](step-2b-register-member.md).

3. **Add your photo** to the class gallery. Instructions are [here](step-3-upload-photo.md).

4. If you prefer to use Mattermost on your smartphone, these [instructions](step-4-mattermost-mobile.md) will get you started.
