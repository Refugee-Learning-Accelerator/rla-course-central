## Using GitLab for Team Projects

In this online course, we will use GitLab repositories to store all of the course materials and the work your team is doing. We went ahead and created a few groups and subgroups to make coordination easier, but you still need to set up your team environment. Just follow the steps below and ping us on Mattermost if you get stuck.

For all the [participants](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/groups/rla/group_members) in this course we created a [RLA group](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla). Within the group, we will also create a number of [subgroups](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/groups/rla/subgroups) and there should be a subgroup with your team name that includes all of your team members.

You can use the sub-group to create a team work space. The work space is a fork of the [team-template project](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/team-template) project. You will commit all your work for the design challenges through this repository. You will also be able to receive materials for the new challenges by pulling from the upstream fork (more about that soon).

If you are new to git or GitLab and some of this doesn't yet make sense, don't worry! We highly recommend working through some of the tutorials on git and GitLab (for example [this one](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/25/gitlab-workflow-an-overview/)) but we will continue to give you step by step instructions, so you should be able to follow along.


In order to on-board yourself to the Refugee Learning Accelerator online course, you need to complete the following steps:

1. Set up accounts for yourself on the Refugee Learning Accelerator instances of Mattermost and GitLab. Instructions are [here](step-1-onboarding.md). Once you have set up both accounts, please introduce yourself in the general channel of [Mattermost](https://mattermost.refugeelearning.site/rla/channels/town-square)!

2. *One person from each team*  will need to set up your team and workspace following [these instructions](step-2a-register-team). 
    + When the team has been set up, the rest of the team should register themselves following [these instructions](step-2b-register-member.md).

3.  Add your photo to the roster. Instructions are [here](step-3-upload-photo.md).

4. You may optionally also set up Mattermost on your smartphone, following instructions [here](step-4-mattermost-mobile.md).
