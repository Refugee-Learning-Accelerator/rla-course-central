# Adding your photo

We would like to create a roster of all accelerator participants with their names and photos. For this, you should add a photo of yourself in your team workspace folder following the steps below.

First, make sure your primary contact has created the team project fork. Once your team has your own project, each team member should add their photo as follows:
1. Navigate to your team's project (e.g. https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/[TEAM_NAME]/team-template).
2. Click on the `photos` directory.
3. Under the navigation bar, click the `+` button and choose `Upload file` from the dropdown.
4. Choose a photo of yourself to upload.
    - **Important:** Please name the file with your GitLab username, e.g. `vahidfazelrezai.jpg`. You must do this *before* you upload the file.
5. Click `Upload`.

After you finish these steps there should be a new commit on your project that adds a your photo file.
