## Origin of the name
We wanted something that really stood out and something that was a play on words.

We went from a list of names. To list a *few*:
HardRandom - Coditt - Byters - BeirutByBit - Complexity - BigOhNo - Probably Programmers - Code and Chill

We also thought of Johnny Cache - Fugscript


***Finally***: We decided to go with Beirut By Bit which developped into BeirutByByte

**It's the triple B threat Y'alll**

## Our Methodology
We try to follow the `lean` approach. Just bare bone essentials. If it's extra, it's ignored.

Salam has a great and amazing background in CAD and hardware.

Emad is a wonderful programmer and software developer.

Ebrahim is an individual who is tedious with documentation and markdown and the occasional graphic design.

Because the team is small and each with his own set of expertise that don't intersect with others. The work flow is efficient and quick.

As a result, for the moment we **don't plan on teaming up with anyone more.**
