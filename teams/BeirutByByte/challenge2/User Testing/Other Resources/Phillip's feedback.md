These are my notes from the project review! Great work and curious to see what you come up with next and how the testing goes.

# *Q: Suggested solution clear?*


* Support teacher teaching large class (30+)
* Based on LASeR presentation (nice!)
* Use student location and electronic testing to facilitate and increase peer-to-peer learning (students who didn’t get it right, turn to those who did)


I really liked the background notes (Brainstorm 2nd session) from the seminar (helped me understand how they got to this idea).

# *Fidelity of prototype (not level of detail = just depth of experience)*

Goal: You want the user to “feel” what it’s like to use the app:


* Make it concrete (rather than labeling the fields)
* Put in a real question (not the word “question”)
* Put in a (crappy) logo, don’t just write the word logo


# *Explained why your picked a particular method to prototype*

* Paper UI > Good choice
* I suspect it seemed like the easiest / fastest way to prototype, which makes sense (but wasn’t specifically mentioned in the submission)


# *What did you learn?*

* Some initial ideas turned out to not be relevant for the user and their challenge, e.g. “Overworked teacher” doesn’t necessarily WANT another tool (great realization!)
* Some of the lessons learned weren’t directly related to the prototype, but maybe the prototype sparked a broader discussion - e.g. features that require Internet connectivity may not be appropriate
* As a result, the team refined and narrowed the scope of the app (nice!)


# *Other things that should (will be) easy to test:*


* How does it feel for a student who got it wrong to have to turn to someone who got it right? * Why not turn it around? (Easy to test)
* Do you really need the location tracking? Does that feel too complicated to do (easy to test) and could students be connected in other, simpler ways (just raise your hand if you got it right) - Or does tracking this data provide useful insight? (Maybe)
