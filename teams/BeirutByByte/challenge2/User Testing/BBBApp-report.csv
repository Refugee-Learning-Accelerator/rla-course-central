As I was reading about the application I kept thinking how useful this will be to students who have a short tension span. they can work on their own and things will be repeated to them as many times as possible.  However, I wonder how the explanation will take place. will it be explained in the same way or in different ways? Will it be based on Bloom's? How will the assessment be made?

My students tend to waste time and foul around every time they have a device in their hands ( iPad/ laptop/etc...). Admins are usually busy with several things that they don't want to add one more task on their to do list.

English/reading would be very different from math or composition, for example, in terms of the data the teacher gathers in the moment.",0,4,"I think the limiting factor is the kind of data the teacher can collect in the moment. My guess is these are questions that have one single correct answer, as in most procedural math or science questions. When the student chooses an incorrect answer, what is the role of the teacher in identifying the misconception behind the incorrect answer? For example, it could be a simple math error or a more conceptual misunderstanding. Is there a way to integrate more nuanced data taking into this process?","2017-11-26 03:42:27","2017-11-26 03:49:56",0f7a918ff6
