# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

## Description

Ibda3 1.0 is a personalized chatbot integrated into hubs at different locations
around the city of Amman. This service allows for refugees in urban settings to query the chatbot
and receive personalized information pertaining to their needs such as low-cost transportation routes, 
and working hours of institutions they frequent. At the hub locations, the service will be offered through 
a tablet device. By being conveniently located near refugees in urban locations, Ibda3 1.0 has the 
added benefit of acting as a community building platform where refugees with similar concerns can meet up and 
assist each other. More importantly, information gathered by Ibda3 1.0 can allow local organizations better cater
their services to the refugees. This reinforcement learning of the Ibda3 1.0 algorithm in addition to the continuous
update given to relevant institutions allows for a more specific response to the refugee population in these urban settings.

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

The issue at hand is the lack of ‘insider knowledge’ as it pertains to resources, 
and social and physical infrastructure, among refugees in host countries, such as Jordan. 
More specifically, it is knowledge that directly impacts the daily life of a refugee as opposed 
to someone in the general public. This lack of accessibility and personalization of information 
presents challenges to the every-day life of a refugee and requires additional effort on their part. 
Examples of this include vocational opportunities in the area, the lowest cost and most convenient 
transportation routes, and the working hours of relevant institutions that a refugee may frequent. 
In the future, as the bot develops a better sense of user needs and habits, it can be converted to 
a mobile application to push suggestions to a user.

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

Ibda3 1.0 is a chatbot that will be located at predetermined hotspots around the city of Amman,
using mobile interfaces such as a laptop/tablet. This implementation method creates a communal 
hub that allows for refugees with similar concerns to find and support each other. Once at these 
centralized locations, individuals can input certain queries, and interact with Ibda3 1.0 in order 
to obtain information specific to their needs.

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

Although applicable to a large cohort, we envision Ibda3 1.0 to initially be implemented among 
late teens and young adults (20s-30s) in urban locations. The reason for choosing this cohort 
is that these are the people who are usually willing and able to work, serving as the sole 
breadwinners for their family. Therefore, facilitating their access to vocational opportunities 
and minimizing their expenses of going out and seeking job opportunities in the conventional way 
will yield positive externalities to their family, and larger community.

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

The value proposition of Ibda3 1.0 is its (1) personalization. (2) community-building and engagement
characteristics, and (3) data collection on refugee behavior. The first allows for a concise amount 
of relevant information to be disseminated to the refugee as it pertains to their specific need. 
Responses such as nearest institutions for completing paperwork, their work hours, and most convenient 
transportation routes can be offered. In this manner, time and money is no longer wasted on journeys 
that may not yield any benefit, due to false and outdated information. The second enables refugee 
populations to form a knowledge-sharing base that can enable community bonding, and strengthening.
Finally, data collection will allow institutions and service providers better tailor their offerings 
and approach. In addition, this data will allow the chatbot to improve itself through adjusting its 
offering to match the most relevant requirements.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

The primary obstacle consists of being able to use Google’s/another data provider’s API to access 
existing information for the required information e.g. institutional work hours, public transportation 
routes, etc. in the geographical area of interest. Moreover, identifying where these centralized hotspots 
will be difficult since they may be prone to the “public good” problem by others in society. Similarly, 
such hubs need to be located in ideal locations to ensure adequate accessibility by the dispersed refugee
population in urban settings.
