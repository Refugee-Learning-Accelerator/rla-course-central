# Challenge 3 Final Project

## Description

We wanted to provide an app for vocabulary learning, through smart phones camera, where the learner will be able to scan objects with his phone camera, and he will see the object's name on the screen in both languages (Arabic - English).
Unfortunately, we are not able to provide a working version until now, because we have some difficulties in deployment on android devices, but we are still commited and working hard to do it.
## Questions

### How did you build it? (Platform and technology)

- We used YOLO for real time object detection (https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
there are some open source projects, which implement YOLO for Android and ios, like:
https://github.com/mdietrichstein/yolo-tiny-v1-mobile
https://github.com/natanielruiz/android-yolo
https://github.com/tran-brian/yolo-unity-integration

- We are planning to use Google translate API for translating.

### What challenges did you face?

We were not able to get any of these projects working either with Android Studio or Unity. We were always stuck with some build errors and incompatibility issues.

### What aspect of the AR experience do you like best? 

We like that the learner can improve his vocabulary while he is at home, classroom, or even at street.

### What would you different in the future? 

We could build our own YOLO implementation from scratch.
